# Solver for the Coundown numbers game
This repo implements a solver for the numbers part of the coundown game using DFS and memoisation. 

## What is Countdown
The Countdown numbers game is a game where you are given 6 numbers (positive integers less than 100) and have to use the standard operators (+, -, *, /) to create the goal number (a positive integer less than 1,000). My code allows for the use of nested brackets e.g. (5 * 2) + (14 /7). You can play countdown at https://happysoft.org.uk/countdown/numgame.php (This is not my website). Thank you to El_Tel for creating the countdown game website and to Channel 4 for creating the game.
